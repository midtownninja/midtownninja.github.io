Government to Citizen Payments: Opportunities Emerge from a Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdowns of public life in its wake have caused severe economic dislocation around the world. Governments are taking unprecedented measures to protect employment, bail out businesses and inoculate against long-term effects of depressed economic activity. Alongside B2B and B2C channels for financial services, these measures are opening up opportunities for a new channel we call G2C, or Government-to-Citizen financial services.

Unlike banks and fintechs who can tailor their offerings to well-defined customer segments, G2C financial services need to be broadly accessible to all citizens of a country. They require the mobilization of financial infrastructure at significant scale and speed for the provision of stimulus checks, unemployment payments, or in some cases guaranteed income. Taxation provides a way for citizens and businesses to pay into the government, whereas for a mature G2C financial services platform, an infrastructure that supports bi-directional flow of funds is essential. To guard against future disruptions and enhance economic resilience, governments will likely seek to outfit this infrastructure for the long term rather than just as a one-off.

The fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic presents a major opportunity for the renovation of financial services infrastructure within the US. Historically, the private sector in the US pioneered several financial innovations that we now take for granted, such as payment cards, deposit insurance and consumer credit. The government has generally stayed away from directly providing financial services to consumers in the modern era, e.g. large-scale, universally accessible financial services such as the US Postal Savings System were shut down in the 1960s. These historical conditions mean that the US government must rely on an unwieldy patchwork of payment methods to deliver payments to its citizens. Some reports showed that over 10% of those eligible for COVID-19 stimulus payments in the US are experiencing delays of several weeks because the IRS needs to furnish them with paper checks. In a society where significant majorities live paycheck to paycheck, the lack of cohesive infrastructure for the government to issue payments to its citizens may thus cause significant financial harm.

The US can look to models in several major global economies for inspiration on how to deliver G2C financial services. In its response to the COVID-19 crisis, Germany has made over $25bn in payments to smaller businesses and freelancers within a matter of days through its state-owned development banks. While some of these payments came from monies earmarked for the COVID-19 crisis, others came from the same payments infrastructure investments that enabled Germany to weather the 2008 financial crisis. In Nordic countries, the tight integration of tax policy and social insurance programs has resulted in a payments infrastructure that enables bidirectional money transfers. Since 2016, India has pioneered a Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system that has seen broad based consumer adoption. UPI is an instant real-time payment and interbank settlement system used as common infrastructure powering payment apps from banks as well as nonbank providers such as Google Pay and Paytm. Developed by a consortium of major Indian banks, UPI currently carried a monthly volume of $29bn across 1.2bn transactions in March 2020, up 86X since March 2017, representing an astonishing monthly growth rate of 139%. The rapid adoption of UPI in India has been driven by its simplicity and decisive government action in standardization. Together, these provide reach to a wide swath of India’s citizens while enabling payment providers to offer distinctive experiences to their customers.

We are in the early innings of G2C financial services, where infrastructure will likely leverage existing payments rails and money transfer mechanisms to maximize reach and minimize provisioning delays. Looking ahead, additional citizen-facing capabilities will likely undergird consumer-facing infrastructure to mitigate the risk that G2C financial services will be disrupted in the future. After the worst of the pandemic, the resulting ‘peace dividend’ of this investment may even pave the way for policy measures with appropriate public support, such as universal basic income. All along this journey, banks, fintechs and other financial services providers can benefit by acting as intermediaries in the delivery of G2C financial services.

American exceptionalism and a high bar for technological sophistication are often cited as reasons for the US to be reticent about taking inspiration from models working in other countries. However, in the case of payments, the potential for foreign operating models in the US context is not constrained by the availability of technology. Consortium-operated P2P payment systems such as Zelle have a sizeable user base in the US. In addition, the entrepreneurial braintrust in the US has created several projects leveraging distributed ledgers, cryptocurrency wallets and related technologies to deliver a high-integrity, decentralized and accessible payment infrastructure. What is lacking so far, however, is adequate direction on standardization that the public sector is uniquely positioned to provide. Without such direction, these projects will only add to the patchwork of consumer-facing payment systems in the US. 

Winston Churchill is reported to have said, “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.” This crisis is a rare opportunity for the government and its agencies to issue an affirmative direction for nationwide payments infrastructure and pave the way to G2C financial services that can benefit citizens as well as the participants within the financial services value chain.
